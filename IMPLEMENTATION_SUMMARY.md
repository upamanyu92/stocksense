### 6. Confidence Scoring ✅

Multi-factor trust score:
```python
trust_score = (
    0.5 * model_confidence +      # Model agreement
    0.3 * data_quality +           # Data reliability
    0.2 * normalized_uncertainty   # Prediction certainty
)
```

Decisions based on trust score:
- **Accept**: trust_score ≥ 0.75 (high confidence)
- **Caution**: 0.60 ≤ trust_score < 0.75 (moderate)
- **Reject**: trust_score < 0.60 (low confidence)

### 7. Prediction Validation ✅

The agentic system integrates seamlessly:

```python
# In prediction_service.py
from app.agents.prediction_coordinator import PredictionCoordinator

# Initialize once
prediction_coordinator = PredictionCoordinator(min_confidence=0.6)

# Use in prediction executor
result = prediction_coordinator.predict(stock_symbol_yahoo, validate=True)

# Fallback if needed
if result['decision'] == 'reject':
    predicted_price = predict_max_profit(stock_symbol_yahoo)
else:
    predicted_price = result['prediction']
```

- Includes fallback mechanisms
- Provides comprehensive logging
- Follows existing code patterns

## Usage

### Simple Usage
```python
from app.agents import PredictionCoordinator

coordinator = PredictionCoordinator()
result = coordinator.predict('AAPL')
print(f"${result['prediction']:.2f} (confidence: {result['confidence']:.2%})")
```

### With Feedback
```python
# Make prediction
result = coordinator.predict('AAPL')

# Later, provide actual result
coordinator.update_with_actual('AAPL', result['prediction'], actual_price)
```

### Via API
```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/agentic/predict/AAPL"
```
