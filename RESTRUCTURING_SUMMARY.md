# API Routes Restructuring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the restructuring of API routes and logging improvements made to the StockSense application.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Routes Restructuring

#### Created New Directory Structure
```
app/routes/
├── __init__.py
├── stock_routes.py          # Stock quote search and health endpoints
├── prediction_routes.py     # Prediction triggering and status endpoints  
├── system_routes.py         # System monitoring and management endpoints
├── auth_routes.py           # User authentication endpoints
├── watchlist_routes.py      # User watchlist management endpoints
└── agentic_routes.py        # AI-powered prediction endpoints
```

#### Moved Routes from main.py
The following routes were extracted from `app/main.py` and organized into dedicated blueprint files:

**stock_routes.py:**
- `/search_quote/<company_name>` - Search for stock quotes
- `/health` - Health check endpoint

**prediction_routes.py:**
- `/prediction_status` - Stream prediction status updates
- `/fetch_quotes_status` - Stream stock quotes fetching status
- `/fetch_stock_quotes` - Fetch and store stock quotes
- `/trigger_prediction` - Trigger batch predictions
- `/get_predictions` - Get paginated prediction results
- `/trigger_watchlist_prediction` - Trigger predictions for user's watchlist

**system_routes.py:**
- `/` - Index/redirect to login
- `/dashboard` - User dashboard
- `/api/system/status` - System status (worker, disk usage)
- `/api/system/uptime` - Application uptime
- `/api/system/cleanup_models` - Clean up old models
- `/api/background_worker/status` - Background worker status stream
- `/api/background-status` - Background worker status

#### Updated main.py
- Reduced from 345 lines to 59 lines (83% reduction)
- Simplified to only handle app initialization and blueprint registration
- Improved logging format to include module name: `%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s`

### 2. Logging Improvements

#### Replaced print() with logging
Updated the following files to use proper logging instead of print statements:

**db/db_executor.py:**
- Added module-level logger
- Replaced all print statements with logger.error()
- Improved error messages with better context

**db/migrate_schema.py:**
- Added logging module
- Converted print statements to logger.info()
- Added proper logging configuration for standalone execution

**services/prediction_service.py:**
- Consolidated redundant logging statements
- Improved log message format for better readability
- Added stock symbol context to all log messages
- Removed verbose timestamps (now handled by logging formatter)

**services/auth_service.py:**
- Replaced print statements with logger.error()
- Added module-level logger

**models/training_script.py:**
- Added logging module
- Converted print statements to logger.info()

#### Enhanced Logging Quality
- Reduced total logging statements while maintaining important information
- Added contextual information (stock symbols, operation type) to log messages
- Used appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Standardized log message format across the application

## Benefits

1. **Better Code Organization:** Routes are now logically grouped by functionality
2. **Easier Maintenance:** Each route file handles a specific domain
3. **Improved Readability:** main.py is now clean and focused on app initialization
4. **Better Logging:** Consistent, informative logging with proper levels and formatting
5. **Easier Testing:** Individual route modules can be tested independently
6. **Scalability:** Easy to add new route modules without cluttering main.py

## Backward Compatibility

All existing API endpoints remain at the same URLs. No breaking changes to the API interface.

## Route Registration

All blueprints are registered in main.py with their respective URL prefixes:
- `auth_bp` - No prefix (/)
- `watchlist_bp` - /api/watchlist
- `stock_bp` - No prefix (/)
- `prediction_bp` - No prefix (/)
- `system_bp` - No prefix (/)
- `agentic_api` - /api/agentic

## Testing

The application has been verified to:
- Import successfully without errors
- Register all blueprints correctly
- Maintain all existing routes and endpoints
