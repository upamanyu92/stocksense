# StockSense

StockSense is a modular, production-ready platform for stock prediction, analysis, and monitoring. It is designed for data scientists, quantitative analysts, and developers who need a robust, extensible system for building, deploying, and monitoring stock market models at scale.

## üöÄ NEW: Agentic Prediction System

StockSense now features an **intelligent agentic prediction system** that autonomously makes high-accuracy predictions through multi-agent collaboration:

- **ü§ñ Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents work together (Data Enrichment, Ensemble, Adaptive Learning)
- **üìà Enhanced Accuracy**: Ensemble methods combine Transformer + LSTM models with adaptive weighting
- **üß† Self-Learning**: Continuously improves from prediction errors and adapts to market conditions
- **üéØ Confidence Scoring**: Every prediction includes confidence levels and uncertainty quantification
- **üîÑ Market Regime Detection**: Automatically adapts strategies for bull/bear/sideways/volatile markets
- **‚úÖ Autonomous Decisions**: Makes intelligent accept/caution/reject decisions on predictions

## ‚ö° NEW: Real-time Features

StockSense now includes comprehensive **real-time capabilities** for live stock monitoring and instant updates:

- **üî¥ Live WebSocket Communication**: Bidirectional real-time data flow
- **üìä Real-time Price Streaming**: Live stock price updates every 10 seconds
- **üìà Interactive Charts**: Auto-updating visualizations with Chart.js
- **üîî Smart Notifications**: Toast-style alerts for important events
- **üëÅÔ∏è Live Prediction Updates**: See predictions as they're generated
- **‚ö° Instant Watchlist Sync**: Multi-device synchronization

## Purpose & Need

Modern financial markets generate vast amounts of data, and actionable insights require advanced analytics, automation, and reliable infrastructure. StockSense addresses these needs by providing:

- **Automated Data Ingestion:** Fetches and stores stock quotes in a local database, supporting batch and scheduled operations.
- **Modular Prediction Pipeline:** Easily plug in new models or update existing ones for stock price prediction.
- **Batch & Real-Time Processing:** Supports both batch predictions and real-time monitoring of model performance.
- **Monitoring & Transparency:** Built-in logging, monitoring, and status streaming for all major operations.
- **Extensibility:** Designed for easy integration with new data sources, models, and deployment environments.

## Key Features
- **Flask Web Dashboard:** Interactive dashboard for triggering predictions, fetching quotes, and viewing results.
- **Real-time Updates:** WebSocket-based live updates for prices, predictions, and background operations.
- **Live Price Streaming:** Track multiple stocks with auto-updating charts.
- **Interactive Charts:** Real-time visualizations powered by Chart.js.
- **Smart Notifications:** Toast-style alerts for important events.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized UI for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices with cross-browser compatibility.
- **Typeahead Search:** Fast, user-friendly search for stock quotes with autocomplete suggestions.
- **Batch Prediction:** Parallelized batch processing for efficient model inference.
- **Model Monitoring:** Track and log model performance and prediction outcomes.
- **Dockerized Deployment:** Ready for production with Docker and Docker Compose support.
- **PEP8 Compliant:** Clean, maintainable codebase.

## Project Structure
- `app/` - Core application logic (database, features, models, services, utils)
- `scripts/` - Utility and management scripts (DB setup, schedulers, etc.)
- `docker/` - Dockerfiles and deployment configuration
- `templates/` - HTML templates for the dashboard
- `static/` - Static assets (CSS, JSON, etc.)
- `.env` - Environment variables

## Setup & Usage
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit as needed.
3. **Initialize the database:**
   - Run scripts from `scripts/` (e.g., `python scripts/create_db.py`).
4. **Start the application:**
   - For local development:
     ```bash
     python -m app.main
     ```
   - For production (Docker):
     ```bash
     docker compose up --build
     ```
   - Using pre-built Docker Hub image:
     ```bash
     docker pull upamanyu92/stocksense:latest
     docker run -p 5005:5005 upamanyu92/stocksense:latest
     ```
5. **Access the dashboard:**
   - Visit `http://localhost:5005` (or your configured port).
